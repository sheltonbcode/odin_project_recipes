    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This super simple steak for two comes together quickly. So quickly, that if your steaks are a little smaller, you'll want to check for doneness sooner than you might expect. But a speedy and easy cooking time doesn't mean this dish won't impress. Let your meat rest before slicing to prevent some of the moisture from escaping, and you'll be dining on a tender, butter-topped strip steak in no time. Slice them thinly and serve with a crusty bread to transform this main into a nice steak sandwich any time of day. Or, if you have leftovers, simply reheat in a skillet and serve with a runny egg for breakfast the next day. No matter how you serve it or slice it, dinner guests won't believe it came straight from your air fryer and not from the famous steak restaurant down the street.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 (8-oz.) beef strip steaks (1-in. thick)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest (from 1 small lemon)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Let steak stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of steaks evenly with salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Preheat air fryer to 400Â°F for 10 minutes. Place steak in fryer basket, and coat top with cooking spray. Cook until desired degree of doneness, 6 minutes for medium-rare, 8 minutes for medium, 10 minutes for medium-well, or 12 minutes for well done. Remove steaks from basket; let rest 5 minutes.</li><br>
