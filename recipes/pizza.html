    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Pizza night has never tasted better. For a true, from-scratch pie, use our Sourdough Pizza Dough recipe for restaurant-quality pizza at home.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 ounces mature sourdough starter</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (100°F to 110°F</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light rye flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon wheat germ</li>
        <li>2 1/4 to 3 cups (about 9 5/8 oz. to 13 7/8 oz.) bread flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine starter, warm water, honey, rye flour, wheat germ, and 1 cup of the bread flour in the bowl of an electric stand mixer; stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Cover; let stand at room temperature until surface is bubbly, about 4 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Fit electric mixer with dough hook. With mixer running on low speed, gradually add 1 1/4 cups bread our to starter mixture, and beat until combined after each addition. Add salt. Increase speed to medium-low, and beat until dough pulls away from sides of bowl, about 6 minutes, adding up to 1 cup additional flour as needed. Transfer dough to a lightly greased bowl. Turn dough to grease top. Cover with plastic wrap; let stand at room temperature until increased in volume, 1 1/2 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Shape dough into 2 equal balls (about 12 ounces each). Cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rise until puffy, about 45 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Use immediately, or wrap in plastic wrap and store in refrigerator up to 24 hours. Let chilled dough come to room temperature before using, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
      </ol>
